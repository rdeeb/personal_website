# My personal website

Hello to my personal website repo, here you can see the insides of the website located at 
[ramydeeb.com](http://ramydeeb.com), the idea is to allow you to check how I coded my website, and what technologies I
used to built it.

I encourage you to browse and if you like it you can base your own site from it.

## Running it

Right now at this moment in time I have a CMS project and a Gatsby Starter team that are not connected, this readme and
those two folders are my first commit.

### CMS

The cms is based on [Strapi.io](http://strapi.io) so to run it in a terminal run:

```
  cd cms
  yarn develop
```

The project is set up to run locally with a sqlite DB

### The Frontend

The Front end is built with Gatsby [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), on a terminal to run it write down

```
  cd frontend
  yarn develop
```
